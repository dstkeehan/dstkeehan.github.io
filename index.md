<b>Hello</b>

I am a doctoral candidate in operations research at the University of Auckland, supervised by [Professor Andy Philpott](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-philpott) and [Associate Professor Andrew Mason](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-mason). My research involves decision making under uncertainty. In particular, I am looking at how decisions (especially multistage decisions) can be improved by distributional robustness when randomness is approximated by data. I expect to graduate in 2025.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Engineering Science from the University of Auckland in April 2022. During my undergraduate degree, I worked in the Department of Mathematics on game theoretical problems in firm location, and in the Department of Physics on Bayesian model inference of gravitational microlensing events.
