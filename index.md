### Hello

I am a [doctoral candidate](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/dkee331) in operations research at the University of Auckland, supervised by [Professor Andy Philpott](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-philpott) and [Associate Professor Andrew Mason](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-mason).

My research involves decision making under uncertainty. In particular, I am looking at how data-driven decisions can be improved by distributional robustness.

Outside of university, I enjoy the sport of Futsal, where I play flanker.
