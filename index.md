I am a doctoral candidate in operations research at the University of Auckland, supervised by [Professor Andy Philpott](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-philpott) and [Associate Professor Andrew Mason](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-mason).

My research involves decision making under uncertainty. In particular, I am looking at how decisions should be made when underlying randomness is approximated by data.
