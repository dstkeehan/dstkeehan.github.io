### Hello

I am a [doctoral candidate](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/dkee331) in operations research at the University of Auckland, supervised by [Professor Andy Philpott](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-philpott) and [Associate Professor Andrew Mason](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-mason).

My research involves decision making under uncertainty. In particular, I am looking at how data-driven can be improved by distributional robustness. I expect to graduate in 2025.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Engineering Science from the University of Auckland in April 2022. Outside of univeristy, I enjoy the sport of Futsal, where I play flanker.
