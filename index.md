### Hello :wave:

I am a [doctoral candidate](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/dkee331) in operations research at the University of Auckland, supervised by [Andy Philpott](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-philpott) and [Andrew Mason](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-mason).

My research involves decision making under uncertainty. In particular, I am looking at how data-driven decisions (especially multistage decisions) converge and can be improved by distributional robustness.

<!---<b>Interests</b>:
<ul>
    <li>Optimisation</li>
    <li>Economics</li>
    <li>Probability and Statistics</li>
</ul>--->

In my spare time I enjoy playing [Futsal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal).
